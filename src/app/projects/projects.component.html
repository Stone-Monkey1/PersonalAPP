    This is a dating app I built using Asp. Net 6, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
    and PostgreSQL. This app was part of a course and my first project.

    2. This website has been my second project. It is the first project I've had
    that was outside of a course, and therefore had free reign to do whatever I
    wanted. It has also been a learning process, and has required a lot of
    review of what I covered in the course. However, I'm proud of what it is and
    what I hope it grows to become.

    This is a hangboard workout sharing website I am developing with a friend of
    mine, who is a back-end devloper. I am using Angular, Html, and CSS. The
    goal is to create a site that allows people to create, save, and publish
    hangboard workouts and have them accessible by other users.
